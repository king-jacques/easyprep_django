Note: for the overall score has a max of 9. 
Overall Score: 5.0 (Average)

Task Achievement: 5/9

• The essay addresses the task and presents a clear opinion on advertising methods being unethical, but lacks detailed development. For example, while the points on how advertisements prey on certain demographics are made, they lack depth and supporting evidence that would strengthen your argument.

• The conclusion does mention the need for regulation, but it is rather vague. Detailed suggestions on how this could be accomplished or specific examples of "plans" would enhance the completion of your task.

• In your arguments, phrases like "intent to have more watcher" could be refined to improve clarity. For instance, you might say "their intention is to attract more viewers."

Coherence and Cohesion: 5/9

• The essay has a basic structure but could improve on logical flow. The transition between points is abrupt. For example, transitions between your points could be enhanced with phrases such as "Furthermore" or "In addition to this."

• Usage of connectors like “In first point of view” and “In second point” are awkward. It would be better to phrase them as “Firstly” and “Secondly” to increase clarity and improve coherence.

• Paragraphing needs to be improved. Often, points were squeezed together. Ensure each key point is presented in a separate paragraph for clearer organization.

Lexical Resource: 5/9

• Vocabulary usage is adequate but lacks variation. Words like "good idea" and "bad effects" are too simplistic. Try to use more descriptive language. For instance, instead of "bad effects," you could use “detrimental consequences” or "adverse impacts."

• There are some errors in word choice and form, such as "my does not need" which should be "may not need."

• To enhance your lexical range, try incorporating more complex phrases. For example, instead of repeating "advertisement," you could use synonyms like "promotional content" or "marketing strategies."

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 5/9

• The essay shows some use of varied sentence structures but is hindered by grammatical errors. For example, "his poor father will be finally obliged to buy the toy" could be revised for clarity: “his father will ultimately feel compelled to buy the toy.”

• There are several typographical and grammar issues, such as "home wife" (which should be "housewife") and incorrect articles like “the advertise” instead of “the advertisements.”

• Pay attention to verb tenses; phrases like "will made them" are incorrect and should be "will make them."

Key Takeaways

1. Develop Arguments: Strengthen your points with more detailed examples and supporting information to better articulate your stance on the topic.

2. Improve Coherence: Use clearer transitions between paragraphs and sections to enhance the flow of your writing.

3. Expand Vocabulary: Incorporate a wider variety of vocabulary and avoid simplistic phrases to enhance lexical richness.

4. Focus on Grammar: Pay careful attention to grammatical accuracy, correct word forms, and punctuation in your writing.
